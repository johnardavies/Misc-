#This code shows a series of example sql selection commands implemented in R

#1. Extracts the culture24 data from the datbase

#filepath to the database
dbfile<-"filepath\\epatculture25.db"

# the dbDriver is labelled sqlite
sqlite = dbDriver("SQLite");

# Assign the connection string to a connection object
mydb = dbConnect(sqlite, dbfile);

#Lists the tables associated with the database
dbListTables(mydb)

#Reads in the table as a data frame, calls it p1

p1 = dbGetQuery(mydb,'select * from culture24venues170616')

#selects all rows and all columns (the * operator) from the table culture24venues170616  where the value of the country column in England
p2=dbGetQuery(mydb,'SELECT * FROM culture24venues170616 WHERE country="England"')

#selects a column (the names column) for all countries where the country column says England
p2=dbGetQuery(mydb,'SELECT names FROM culture24venues170616 WHERE country="England"')

#As previous command, but this command only returns 10 rows
p2=dbGetQuery(mydb,'SELECT names FROM culture24venues170616 WHERE country="England" Limit 10')

#selects all rows from the table culture24venues170616 where the types column contains the value Museum somewhere
p2=dbGetQuery(mydb,'SELECT * FROM culture24venues170616 WHERE types LIKE "%Museum%"')

#selects all rows from the table culture24venues170616 where the types column contains the value Museum AND the value Gallery somewhere
p2=dbGetQuery(mydb,'SELECT * FROM culture24venues170616 WHERE types LIKE "%Museum%" AND types LIKE "%Gallery%"')

#selects all rows from the table culture24venues170616 where the types column contains the value Museum OR the value Gallery somewhere
p2=dbGetQuery(mydb,'SELECT * FROM culture24venues170616 WHERE types LIKE "%Museum%" OR types LIKE "%Gallery%"')
